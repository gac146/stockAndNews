    "The stock market allows companies to raise money by offering stock shares and in return, investors get to participate in the companies for benefits of making money through the dividends, shares pay out, and by selling stocks at a profit. Measured value of stocks is a source of data to gauge the well-being of the United States economy (Investopedia). Because any trade (buy or sell) is reflected in real-time, there is no particular way to know the value of the stocks until after each trade has occurred. Thus, any information to predict the direction of a company’s stock is extremely advantageous. Information about companies is most commonly reported via new media and then spread on the Internet. When any news striking event happens, whether that’s earning reports or announcement of a new product, media outlets would most likely cover that event. That means that the amount of attention towards that particular company would increase, generating interest to buy or sell. As Investopedia explains, negative news will normally cause individuals to sell stocks and positive news will cause individuals to buy stocks. <br/>\n",
    "A paper by Gusev and Kroujiline et al., “Predictable markets? A news‐driven model of the stock market” discusses the predictability of stock markets via a news-driven model. They found that the\tstock market\tdynamics can be explained in terms of the interaction\tamong three variables: direct information, investor sentiment and market price. Our project explores the relationship between two of these variables which may inseparably be related to investor sentiment. They also noted that the coupling of price and information creates feedback, whereby information causes price changes and price changes generate information. \n",

    "*Data Cleaning (2-3 sentences)* <br/>\n",
    "To clean our stock price data we don't want or need the data at too granular of a level at say by the second price. So we will need to average out this data over a time frame that fits our needs (by hour). For our media title data we will need to scrape the web page and connect to an API and clean out any extraneous data besides the article title, company it is talking about, date published, and site published on. We will either use Beautifulsoup to scrape the news site or an API to pull the data and then use a Pandas dataframe to store and then delete out extraneous data like we have been taught in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Data Analysis (1-2 paragraphs)* <br/>\n",
    "We will recognize data that involve all kinds of mentioning about a company by parsing the data string and searching for the keywords about a company (name, ticker, website domain, it’s products, and words that have positive/negative connotations ...). We will also calculate the derivative (how rapid the stock value changes) specifically on each point of day (by finite difference method or provided) by Finite Difference or other straightforward mathematical methods depending on the complexity of data we fetched and cleaned. We store the data in pandas dataframe, indexed by time or the frequency a company appears on social media as they are the independent variables of our data visualizations (see below). Time axis should be preferably a uniformly segmented timeline (by days/half days) for simple organization and understandability. \n",
    "To classify our data as either positive or negative we are going to build two dictionaries.\n",
    "One of the dictionaries will have words with a positive connotation and the other one with negative connotation. We will get news articles titles (tweets, and other social media posts) that mention the companies we are trying to analyze and we'll run them through our dictionaries. Depending on the ratio of positive to negative words found, we would classify them as negative or positive. \n",
    "\n",
    "*What to report (2-3 sentences)* <br/>\n",
    "We plan to report what type of correlation there is between positive/negative news articles and the fluctuation in stock price. The key visualization involves: 1) the mentioning positive frequency/negative/total frequency vs. time graph, 2) the change of stock price vs. time graph, and 3) the change of stock price vs. frequency graph for the companies we research. The key analytical conclusion involves model fit parameter for graph 3 and other statistical parameters such as R-square, t-value, p-value etc. that contribute to the resulting findings. \n",

Therefore, it could be handled by anonymizing the data with the SafeHarbor method and simply associating these trends solely by assigning a company to a number, and only the frequency of mentions and its fluctuation on stock prices as variables.<br/>\n",
    "As we’d also be needing to scrape thousands of datasets per request of the project, it is also important to note that Yahoo Finance may take notice of the scraping of large datasets and possibly mistake it for malicious intent or a DDoS attack. Therefore it is important to scrape the data at a reasonably paced rate to not raise any flags on their detection systems as well as affect their server’s performance.\n"

    "The results of our analysis may help us better understand the connection between media reports and stock price. The results of this project may give the stock market society an advantageous prediction for near future trends. If there is a rise in positive headlines, then it may be a good idea to start investing in a company. If there is a rise in negative headlines, then it may be a good idea to sell the current holdings in preparation for a drop. In addition, we may be able to discover the extent of the effect social buzz has on stock prices/investments. We might also be able to pinpoint certain factors to shed some light as to how or why there is such an effect (e.g. “Does the media mostly report on companies in a positive light?”, “Does the media have interests to report on companies positively?”). If there is no strong correlation between social buzz and stock price, then similarly we might discover why social buzz does not have a strong effect on stock prices. <br/>\n",
    "If our hypothesis is wrong or shows up to be inconclusive then it is possible that our classification of positive/negative sentiment was wrong and we would have to re-evaluate how we are classifying words. It also could have been that just looking at the news titles doesn't provide enough insight into the actual article or what that piece of news is actually reporting so we might have to scrape entire news articles instead. Basically we would have to broaden our scope in order to figure out where our problem is coming from. <br/>\n",
    "There are some potential pitfalls that might create problems. The data that we use might be skewed by the time period. For example, we might pick data in which there was a “craze” towards investing at the time. We may also unintentionally have too many companies centered around certain industries in our dataset. Certain factors affecting some industries may wrongly influence other industries. Certain trends in the media/reporting may impact our data. For example, if bad news about one company led to the entire industry declining slightly in stock prices. We also have to be careful with how we classify positive and negative correlation and to make sure we have a robust enough database in order to classify a large number of articles. \n"
